# C-Practice-Examples
This repository contains some C console applications written by me years ago. You are free to use them, change them or do whatever the heck you want. 
If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.<br/>

**CompoundInterest**     -> A very simple compound interest calculator.<br/>
**InsertionSortRandom**  -> Sorting manually or randomly entered numbers given ranges using Insertion Sort algorithms. Additionally generates random lottery numbers.<br/>
**MergeSortPractice**    -> It does the same thing as InsertionSortRandom but uses the Merge Sorth algorithm. Faster but uses more memory.<br/>
**MatrixMulti**          -> It multiplies the entered matrixes or generates a random matrix and multiplies them.<br/>
**PrimeNumCounter**      -> It finds prime numbers using an advanced sieve of eratosthenes algorithm. It is faster than the classical algorithm because it marks even numbers as false in the first place, thus skipping half the numbers while performing operations.<br/>
**Weekday**              -> Calculates which day the given date coincides.<br/>
